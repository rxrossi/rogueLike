# Roguelike dungeon crawler game 
A dungeon game, to move the character use the keyboard arrows, you finish the game when you kill the boss.
Remember to use the pots, each map level has a weapon, from brooms to fire swords
Kill a good number of enemies before moving to the next level, otherwise you won't gain experience, won't level up and won't be strong enough to kill enemies/boss on the next levels

## Stack
- Uses React and redux
- includes testing of complex functions on jest (go easy on me, was one of the first things I've made)

##
- The map is procedurally generated, each time it is different, to give a better sense of progress and to feel like an actual cave, instead of aleatory placing terrain, each room is placed based on the last terrain placed so it feels more likely a map level has an start and an end
- Challenging
- The name of the weapons are funny (best thing in the project)
